# Technical Document for Stored Procedure: `dbo.dt_verstamp007`

## Procedure Overview
The `dbo.dt_verstamp007` stored procedure is designed to return the version number of the stored procedures used by the Microsoft Visual Database Tools. This specific version number indicates the release and version used by these tools, facilitating proper version management and compatibility checks.

## Input Parameters
This stored procedure does not require any input parameters.

## Output Parameters
This stored procedure does not include any explicit output parameters, but it returns a result set containing the version number.

## Logic Description
The stored procedure contains straightforward logic with the following steps:
1. **Procedure Declaration**: The procedure is declared with the name `dbo.dt_verstamp007`.
2. **Return Version Number**: Upon invocation, the procedure executes a SELECT statement that returns the version number `7005`.

### Detailed Steps
1. **Start of Procedure**:
   ```sql
   create procedure dbo.dt_verstamp007
   ```
   This line defines the procedure with the name `dbo.dt_verstamp007`.

2. **Return Version Number**:
   ```sql
   as
   select 7005
   ```
   The procedure selects and returns the integer `7005`, which represents the version number `7.0.05`.

## Dependencies
This stored procedure does not reference or modify any tables, views, or other stored procedures. It is entirely self-contained and independent.

## Example Usage
Here is an example of how to call the `dbo.dt_verstamp007` stored procedure and retrieve the version number:

```sql
-- Example usage of dbo.dt_verstamp007 stored procedure
EXEC dbo.dt_verstamp007;
```

Expected Result:
```
7005
```

## Error Handling
This stored procedure does not include explicit error handling mechanisms such as TRY-CATCH blocks. However, since it involves a simple SELECT statement, the likelihood of encountering runtime errors is minimal. Any errors would typically relate to execution permissions or database engine problems, rather than procedural logic errors.

## Performance Considerations
The `dbo.dt_verstamp007` stored procedure is optimized for performance owing to its simplicity. Specifically:
- The procedure runs a single SELECT statement, which executes very quickly and imposes negligible load on the database server.
- There are no complex joins, conditions, loops, or subqueries that could impact performance.

### Recommendations
- Since the procedureâ€™s logic is immutable and its performance impact is minimal, no further optimizations are necessary.

## Version History
This procedure is documented as returning version `7.0.05`. Any changes to the versioning or additional functionalities would be reflected in updates to the procedure and documented in this section.
