# Technical Document for Stored Procedure: `dbo.dt_getpropertiesbyid_vcs`

## Procedure Overview:
The stored procedure `dbo.dt_getpropertiesbyid_vcs` is designed to retrieve the value of a specific property associated with a given object ID from the `dbo.dtproperties` table. This procedure is particularly useful in scenarios where metadata or configuration properties need to be fetched dynamically based on object identifiers. The typical business use case includes retrieving configuration settings, property values, or additional metadata required for application logic or reporting purposes.

## Input Parameters:
- **@id** (int): 
  - **Purpose**: This parameter represents the unique identifier of the object whose property value we want to retrieve.
  - **Expected Values/Constraints**: This should be a valid integer that corresponds to an `objectid` in the `dbo.dtproperties` table.

- **@property** (varchar(64)): 
  - **Purpose**: This parameter specifies the name of the property whose value needs to be fetched.
  - **Expected Values/Constraints**: This should be a valid property name existing in the `dbo.dtproperties` table for the given `objectid`.

## Output Parameters:
- **@value** (varchar(255)): 
  - **Purpose**: This output parameter will hold the value of the specified property after the execution of the stored procedure.
  - **Significance**: The output is significant for the calling process to use the retrieved value for further operations or decision-making.
  - **Expected Values/Constraints**: This will be either a string value corresponding to the property's value or `NULL` if no matching record is found.

## Logic Description:
### Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. **Initialization**:
    - The procedure starts with the `SET NOCOUNT ON` statement to avoid sending row count messages to the client after the execution of each statement, which can improve performance.
  
2. **Subquery Selection**:
    - The `SELECT @value = (...)` statement assigns the result of the nested `SELECT` query to the `@value` output parameter.
  
3. **Subquery**:
    - The subquery retrieves the `value` from the `dbo.dtproperties` table where the `objectid` matches `@id` and the `property` name matches `@property`.
  
4. **Output Assignment**:
    - If a matching record is found, the corresponding `value` is assigned to the `@value` output parameter; otherwise, `@value` remains `NULL`.

## Dependencies:
- **Tables**:
  - **dbo.dtproperties**:
    - **Role**: This table stores the property values associated with different objects identified by their `objectid`. The stored procedure queries this table to fetch the required property value.
  
## Example Usage:
### Sample SQL Script to Call the Procedure:
```sql
DECLARE @OutputValue VARCHAR(255);

EXEC dbo.dt_getpropertiesbyid_vcs
    @id = 101, 
    @property = 'ConfigSetting1',
    @value = @OutputValue OUTPUT;

SELECT @OutputValue AS RetrievedValue;
```
#### Example Explanation:
In this example, the procedure retrieves the value of the property `ConfigSetting1` for the `objectid` 101 from the `dbo.dtproperties` table and stores it in the `@OutputValue` variable. The result is then selected and displayed.

## Error Handling:
- The current implementation of this stored procedure does not include explicit error handling like TRY-CATCH blocks. However, it is worth noting that:
  - Any internal SQL error such as a datatype mismatch or invalid column retrieval will cause the procedure to fail with a generic SQL error message.
  - When the `objectid` or `property` does not match, the `@value` parameter will simply be set to `NULL`, which implicitly handles the "not found" scenario without raising an error.

## Performance Considerations:
- **SET NOCOUNT ON**: This can improve the performance by reducing the network traffic between the SQL server and the client application.
- **Indexing**: Ensure that `dbo.dtproperties` table is properly indexed on `objectid` and `property` columns to speed up the search operations.
- **Efficient Use**: It is recommended to call the procedure in the scope where minimal data transfer is required and to handle null scenarios on the client side efficiently.

## Version History:
- **Initial Version**: Created on [Date of Creation], this version includes the basic functionality to fetch a property value by object ID and property name without explicit error handling or additional validation logic.

By following this comprehensive technical documentation, database administrators, developers, and analysts can effectively understand, utilize, and maintain the `dbo.dt_getpropertiesbyid_vcs` stored procedure within the larger database system.
