# Technical Document for Stored Procedure: dbo.dt_displayoaerror_u

### Procedure Overview
The stored procedure `dbo.dt_displayoaerror_u` serves as a deprecated wrapper for the `dbo.dt_displayoaerror` procedure. It aims to ensure backward compatibility by forwarding its calls to `dbo.dt_displayoaerror`. This maintains existing functionality without requiring changes to legacy systems that rely on the older procedure name.

### Input Parameters
The procedure takes the following input parameters:

1. **@iObject** (int)
   - **Purpose:** Identifier for the specific object related to the error.
   - **Expected Values:** Any integer value representing an object ID.
   - **Constraints:** Must be a valid integer.

2. **@iresult** (int)
   - **Purpose:** Result code or status indicator related to the operation.
   - **Expected Values:** Any integer value representing a status or result code.
   - **Constraints:** Must be a valid integer.

### Output Parameters
This procedure does not define any output parameters.

### Logic Description
The logic within the `dbo.dt_displayoaerror_u` stored procedure is straightforward:
1. The procedure begins by ensuring that the `NOCOUNT` option is set, which prevents the message indicating the number of affected rows from being returned.
2. The procedure then calls the `dbo.dt_displayoaerror` stored procedure, passing along the `@iObject` and `@iresult` parameters to it.

#### Step-by-step Explanation:
1. **Set NOCOUNT ON:**
    ```sql
    set nocount on
    ```
    - This command stops the message indicating the number of rows affected by a T-SQL statement from being sent back to the calling client. This is useful for improving performance and reducing unnecessary network traffic.
  
2. **Forward Call to `dbo.dt_displayoaerror`:**
    ```sql
    exec dbo.dt_displayoaerror @iObject, @iresult
    ```
    - The procedure then forwards its parameters to the `dbo.dt_displayoaerror` procedure to ensure backward compatibility. 

### Dependencies
The `dbo.dt_displayoaerror_u` procedure directly depends on the existence of another stored procedure:
- **`dbo.dt_displayoaerror`**
  - **Role:** This is the actual procedure that handles the error display logic originally intended for `dbo.dt_displayoaerror_u`.
  
### Example Usage
Here is an example of how to call the `dbo.dt_displayoaerror_u` procedure:

```sql
DECLARE @ObjectID INT = 123
DECLARE @ResultCode INT = 0

EXEC dbo.dt_displayoaerror_u @iObject = @ObjectID, @iresult = @ResultCode
```
- **@ObjectID:** Example object identifier.
- **@ResultCode:** Example result code.

### Error Handling
The `dbo.dt_displayoaerror_u` procedure does not implement additional error handling mechanisms on its own. Errors will propagate from the `dbo.dt_displayoaerror` procedure as is. The assumption is that error handling is managed within `dbo.dt_displayoaerror`.

### Performance Considerations
Given the simplicity of this procedure, there are limited performance considerations. Nevertheless:
- **NOCOUNT ON:** This feature helps reduce unnecessary message traffic between the server and the client.
- **Procedure Overhead:** There is minimal overhead since this procedure merely acts as a proxy to the `dbo.dt_displayoaerror` procedure.

### Version History
- **Version 1.0:**
  - **Date:** [Add date of creation]
  - **Description:** Initial creation of `dbo.dt_displayoaerror_u` to forward calls to `dbo.dt_displayoaerror` for maintaining backward compatibility.
