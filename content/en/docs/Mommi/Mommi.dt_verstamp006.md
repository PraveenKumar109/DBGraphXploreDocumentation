# Technical Document for Stored Procedure: `dbo.dt_verstamp006`

## Procedure Overview
The stored procedure `dbo.dt_verstamp006` is designed to return the version number for the stored procedures used by legacy versions of the Microsoft Visual Database Tools. This version number is currently `7.0.00`, represented as `7000`. This procedure helps in identifying and maintaining compatibility with legacy database tools by providing a consistent versioning scheme.

## Input Parameters
This procedure does not accept any input parameters.

## Output Parameters
This procedure does not produce any output parameters but returns a single scalar value.

## Logic Description
The procedure performs the following operations:

1. Initiate a selection process to return the hardcoded version number.
2. The procedure consists of a single SQL `SELECT` statement that returns the value `7000`.

```sql
create procedure dbo.dt_verstamp006
as
	select 7000
```

### Step-by-Step Logic:
1. **Procedure Declaration**: The procedure is declared with the name `dbo.dt_verstamp006`.
2. **Select Statement**: The `SELECT 7000` statement is executed to return the version number for the stored procedures.

## Dependencies
This stored procedure does not reference or modify any tables, views, or other stored procedures. It operates independently and can be called without any dependencies.

## Example Usage
To demonstrate how to call the stored procedure `dbo.dt_verstamp006`, the following example is provided:

```sql
-- Example of calling the stored procedure
exec dbo.dt_verstamp006;
```

**Expected Result:**
```
7000
```

When the procedure is executed, it will return the integer value `7000`.

## Error Handling
Since this stored procedure contains only a single `SELECT` statement and does not involve complex operations or input parameters, it does not include any explicit error handling mechanisms like TRY-CATCH blocks. The procedure is straightforward and expected to run without causing errors under normal circumstances.

## Performance Considerations
- **Optimization Techniques Used**: No specific optimization techniques are necessary due to the simplicity of the procedure. The single `SELECT` statement is efficient and quick to execute.
- **Potential Performance Bottlenecks**: There are no performance bottlenecks identified, as this procedure does not involve complex logic or large data processing.
- **Recommendations for Efficient Use**: This procedure runs efficiently without requiring special considerations. It can be called whenever the version information needs to be retrieved.

## Version History
This document includes an optional section for tracking updates to the procedure:
- **Initial Version**: 
  - **Date**: Initial version creation
  - **Description**: Created the stored procedure to return version number `7.0.00` as `7000`.

This section can be updated with future modifications as needed to keep track of changes to the procedure.
