## Technical Document for Stored Procedure: `dbo.dt_dropuserobjectbyid`

### Procedure Overview
The `dbo.dt_dropuserobjectbyid` stored procedure is designed to delete a specific record from the `dbo.dtproperties` table based on the provided object ID. This procedure is commonly used in scenarios where there's a need to remove user-defined objects or properties stored within the `dtproperties` table in the database. It ensures that the specified object is efficiently deleted from the `dtproperties` table.

### Input Parameters
- **@id**: 
  - **Data Type**: `int`
  - **Purpose**: This parameter specifies the unique identifier (`objectid`) of the record to be deleted from the `dbo.dtproperties` table.
  - **Expected Values or Constraints**: The value should be a valid integer that corresponds to an existing `objectid` in the `dbo.dtproperties` table. It should not be NULL.

### Output Parameters
There are no output parameters for this stored procedure.

### Logic Description
1. **Set NOCOUNT**: The procedure begins by setting `NOCOUNT` on, which prevents the message that shows the number of rows affected by a SQL statement from being returned. This is typically done to improve performance and avoid unnecessary network traffic.
   ```sql
   set nocount on
   ```
  
2. **Delete Operation**: The core functionality of the procedure is to delete a row from the `dbo.dtproperties` table where the `objectid` matches the `@id` provided as an input parameter.
   ```sql
   delete from dbo.dtproperties where objectid = @id
   ```

### Dependencies
- **Tables**:
  - **dbo.dtproperties**: This table stores user-defined properties and their details. The `dbo.dt_dropuserobjectbyid` procedure directly modifies this table by deleting specified rows.
- **Stored Procedures**: None referenced.

### Example Usage
Below is an example showing how to call the `dbo.dt_dropuserobjectbyid` stored procedure:

```sql
-- Example SQL script to call the stored procedure
DECLARE @ObjectId INT;
SET @ObjectId = 123; -- Example object ID to be deleted

-- Calling the stored procedure
EXEC dbo.dt_dropuserobjectbyid @id = @ObjectId;
```

### Error Handling
The currently provided stored procedure does not include explicit error handling mechanisms such as `TRY-CATCH` blocks. As a result, any errors encountered during the execution of the `DELETE` statement (e.g., attempting to delete a record that does not exist) will result in a default SQL Server error message.

To enhance the error handling, the procedure can be modified as follows:

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE dbo.dt_dropuserobjectbyid
    @id INT
AS
BEGIN
    SET NOCOUNT ON;

    BEGIN TRY
        DELETE FROM dbo.dtproperties WHERE objectid = @id;
    END TRY
    BEGIN CATCH
        -- Handle errors
        DECLARE @ErrorMessage NVARCHAR(4000);
        DECLARE @ErrorSeverity INT;
        DECLARE @ErrorState INT;
        
        SELECT 
            @ErrorMessage = ERROR_MESSAGE(),
            @ErrorSeverity = ERROR_SEVERITY(),
            @ErrorState = ERROR_STATE();
        
        RAISERROR (@ErrorMessage, @ErrorSeverity, @ErrorState);
    END CATCH
END;
```

### Performance Considerations
- **Index Utilization**: Ensure that the `objectid` column in the `dtproperties` table has an appropriate index to optimize the performance of the `DELETE` operation.
- **Batch Processing**: For large datasets, consider implementing batch processing to manage deletion processes more efficiently.
- **NOCOUNT Option**: The use of `SET NOCOUNT ON` helps reduce network traffic and improves performance by not sending the count of affected rows.

### Version History
(Optional based on organization needs)
- **Version 1**:
  - **Date**: Initial Creation
  - **Description**: Basic implementation of the stored procedure to delete an object by its ID from `dtproperties` table.
