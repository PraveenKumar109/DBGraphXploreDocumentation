# Technical Document for Stored Procedure: dbo.dt_generateansiname

## Procedure Overview
The `dbo.dt_generateansiname` stored procedure generates a unique ANSI name to be used in the `dtproperties.value` column. This procedure is designed to ensure that the generated name does not already exist within the specified column, thus preventing any duplicates. The typical business use case would be when creating entities that require unique identifiers for proper management and referencing within the database.

## Input Parameters
This stored procedure does not take any input parameters in the traditional sense but uses an output parameter:

- **@name** (varchar(255)): This output parameter will hold the generated unique ANSI name. The expected value will be a string prefixed with 'MSDT-A-' followed by a unique number.

## Output Parameters
- **@name** (varchar(255)): The output parameter that will be populated with a unique ANSI name. If the procedure detects that the index exceeds 9999, it sets the value to 'DIAGRAM' as a fallback.

## Logic Description
1. **Variable Declaration:**
    - `@prologue` (varchar(20)): Holds the prefix 'MSDT-A-'.
    - `@indexstring` (varchar(20)): Holds the suffix number in string format.
    - `@index` (integer): A counter that starts from 1 and increments until a unique name is found.

2. **Initialization:**
    - Set `@prologue` to 'MSDT-A-'.
    - Set `@index` to 1.

3. **Main Loop:**
    - A while loop runs indefinitely to generate and check the uniqueness of the ANSI name.
    - Convert `@index` to a string and concatenate it to `@prologue` to form the `@name`.
    - Check if the generated name exists in the `dtproperties.value` column.
    - If the name does not exist, break the loop.
    - If the name exists, increment `@index` by 1.

4. **Index Overflow Handling:**
    - If `@index` reaches 10000, set `@name` to 'DIAGRAM' and exit the loop.
    
5. **Completion:**
    - Return the generated unique name or 'DIAGRAM' if the overflow condition is met.

## Dependencies
- **Table:** `dtproperties`
  - **Column:** `value` - The procedure queries this column to ensure that the newly generated name does not exist already.

## Example Usage
```sql
DECLARE @generatedName VARCHAR(255);
EXEC dbo.dt_generateansiname @generatedName OUTPUT;
PRINT @generatedName;
```
In this example, `@generatedName` will be populated with a unique name starting with 'MSDT-A-' or 'DIAGRAM' if the index exceeds 9999.

## Error Handling
This procedure does not explicitly use TRY-CATCH blocks, but it includes a simple form of error handling:
- If the index exceeds 9999, it jumps to the `TooMany` label and sets the output to 'DIAGRAM' to prevent an infinite loop.

## Performance Considerations
- The procedure uses a simple loop to increment the index and check for uniqueness, which could potentially become a performance bottleneck if the `dtproperties` table is heavily populated.
- It's essential to monitor the frequency of this procedure's execution to ensure it does not become a significant performance hit on the database.
- It might be beneficial to optimize the invocation times and ensure the `dtproperties` table is properly indexed to improve the `IF NOT EXISTS` query performance.

## Version History
- **Initial Version:** Created and defined on [insert date], addressing the need for generating unique ANSI names within the `dtproperties` table.

**Note:** Please update the document with any subsequent changes, including dates and the modifications made.
