# Technical Document for Stored Procedure `dbo.dt_setpropertybyid_u`

## Procedure Overview

**Name:** `dbo.dt_setpropertybyid_u`

**Purpose:**
The purpose of this stored procedure is to manage properties of database objects. Specifically, it either resets an existing property or adds a new property for a given object. This is useful in scenarios where metadata associated with database objects needs to be updated or inserted.

**Business Use Case:**
This procedure is useful in a database management context where properties such as descriptive names, classifications, or other metadata need to be dynamically added or updated for database objects. This is typically used within administrative, maintenance, or metadata management tasks.

## Input Parameters

1. **@id**
   - **Data Type:** int
   - **Purpose:** Represents the ID of the object in the `sysobjects` table.
   - **Expected Values:** Any valid ID corresponding to an object in the `sysobjects` table.

2. **@property**
   - **Data Type:** varchar(64)
   - **Purpose:** The name of the property to update or add.
   - **Expected Values:** A string with a maximum length of 64 characters representing the property name.

3. **@uvalue**
   - **Data Type:** nvarchar(255)
   - **Purpose:** The text value of the property.
   - **Expected Values:** A Unicode string with a maximum length of 255 characters. Can accept null values.

4. **@lvalue**
   - **Data Type:** image
   - **Purpose:** The binary value of the property.
   - **Expected Values:** Binary data. Can accept null values.

## Output Parameters

None.

## Logic Description

1. **Initialization:**
   - `SET NOCOUNT ON;` is used to improve performance by preventing the sending of DONE_IN_PROC messages to the client for each statement in a stored procedure. 

2. **ANSI Translation:**
   - If `@uvalue` is not null, an ANSI equivalent `@avalue` is evaluated.
   - If `@uvalue` can be converted to `varchar(255)` without loss, `@avalue` is set to this ANSI string.
   - If `@uvalue` cannot be converted losslessly and the `@property` is 'DtgSchemaNAME', the `dt_generateansiname` stored procedure is called to generate an ANSI name for `@avalue`.

3. **Property Existence Check and Update/Insert:**
   - The procedure checks if the property already exists in the `dtproperties` table.
   - If the property exists:
     - The `value`, `uvalue`, and `lvalue` fields are updated.
     - The `version` count is incremented by 1.
   - If the property does not exist:
     - A new row is inserted into the `dtproperties` table with the provided property and values.
     - The initial version is set to 0 automatically.

## Dependencies

1. **Tables:**
   - `dbo.dtproperties`: Used to store properties of database objects.
   - `sysobjects`: Implicitly referenced for object IDs.

2. **Stored Procedures:**
   - `dbo.dt_generateansiname`: Called to generate an ANSI-valid name when needed.

## Example Usage

```sql
-- Example call to the stored procedure
EXEC dbo.dt_setpropertybyid_u
    @id = 101, 
    @property = 'Description', 
    @uvalue = N'Example description for object 101', 
    @lvalue = 0x1234567890 -- Example binary data
```

Expected Result:
- If the property 'Description' for object ID 101 exists, its values are updated.
- If it does not exist, a new property is added.

## Error Handling

- This procedure does not include specific error handling mechanisms like `TRY-CATCH` blocks.
- Possible errors are managed implicitly by SQL Server. For example:
  - Inserting a record with duplicate keys would cause a primary key violation which will throw an error naturally.
  - Conversion errors will also throw exceptions automatically.

## Performance Considerations

- **SET NOCOUNT ON:** Improves performance by reducing unnecessary network traffic.
- **Conditional Updates/Inserts:** Efficiently checks for the existence of properties before deciding to update or insert, minimizing data modifications.

### Recommendations for Efficient Use:
- Ensure indices on the `dtproperties` table, especially on the columns `objectid` and `property`, to speed up existence checks and updates/inserts.
- Use appropriate data types for parameters to avoid conversion overheads.

## Version History

_None provided in the original procedure definition._

### Example:

| Date       | Version | Description                        |
|------------|---------|------------------------------------|
| 2023-10-01 | 1.0     | Initial creation of the procedure. |
