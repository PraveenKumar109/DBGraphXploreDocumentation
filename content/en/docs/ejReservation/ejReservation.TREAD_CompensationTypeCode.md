#### Procedure Overview
The stored procedure `[dbo].[TREAD_CompensationTypeCode]` is designed to retrieve all records from the `CompensationTypeCode` table in the `ejReservation` database. This procedure is used to extract information about different types of compensation codes, including their IDs, codes, and descriptions. This is particularly useful for applications that need to display or process compensation codes, such as reservation systems in the hospitality industry.

#### Input Parameters
This stored procedure does not accept any input parameters.

#### Output Parameters
This stored procedure does not have any output parameters that are explicitly declared. However, it returns a result set with the following columns:
- **CompensationTypeCodeID**: `INT` - The unique identifier for each compensation type code.
- **CompensationTypeCode**: `VARCHAR` - The code representing the type of compensation.
- **CompensationTypeCodeDesc**: `VARCHAR` - The description of the compensation type code.

#### Logic Description
The logic of the stored procedure can be broken down into the following steps:

1. **Set NOCOUNT ON**
   - This statement is used to suppress the message indicating the number of rows affected by a T-SQL statement, which can improve performance by reducing network traffic.

2. **SELECT Statement**
   - Retrieves the columns `CompensationTypeCodeID`, `CompensationTypeCode`, and `CompensationTypeCodeDesc` from the `CompensationTypeCode` table in the `ejReservation` database.
   - The table is queried with a `NOLOCK` hint, which allows reading the table without acquiring locks, thus avoiding blocking scenarios.

3. **OPTION (MAXDOP 1)**
   - This query hint restricts the query execution to a single processor, which can be used to control CPU usage and improve concurrent performance.

#### Dependencies
- **Table**: `[ejReservation].[dbo].[CompensationTypeCode]`
  - This table holds data related to the different types of compensation codes including their IDs, codes, and descriptions.
  
#### Example Usage
```sql
-- Example usage of the stored procedure [dbo].[TREAD_CompensationTypeCode]

EXEC [dbo].[TREAD_CompensationTypeCode]
```
This call will return the list of all compensation type codes along with their descriptions.

#### Error Handling
This stored procedure does not explicitly include error handling mechanisms such as TRY-CATCH blocks. It operates under the assumption that the underlying table exists and can be accessed without errors.

#### Performance Considerations
- **NOLOCK Hint**: This can improve performance by reducing lock contention but at the expense of potentially reading uncommitted data (dirty reads).
- **MAXDOP 1**: This limits the execution to a single CPU, which can be useful for controlling resource usage. However, it may also restrict performance optimization opportunities that benefit from parallel processing.

#### Version History
- **Initial Version**: Created on [date not provided], includes basic retrieval logic with performance consideration via NOLOCK and MAXDOP 1.
- **Updates**: [Details of any updates including dates, descriptions of changes, performance improvements, etc., can be added here once any modifications are made.]
